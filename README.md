# Diabetes-Prediction
This project aims to predict diabetes, based on the dataset, done as a part of the Machine Learning Nanodegree program at Udacity.
I used three machine learning classification algorithms (AdaBoost, Random Fores, and Support Vector Machines), which are trained to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, then chooses the best model based on some evaluation and optimize it by tunning its hyperparameters.
